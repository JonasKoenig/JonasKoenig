### Hello GitHub

My name is Jonas and I am a computer science MSc based in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. In an attempt to make programming more accessible and keep track of techniques I learned, I created a repository called [Code On My Mind](https://github.com/JonasKoenig/CodeOnMyMind#code-on-my-mind). Check it out and feel free to reuse and modify any code you see there.

Lately, I have been primarily working with JavaScript and Python. JavaScript offers a huge community of programmers and allows for quick and easy demostrations. Combined with the Processing library [p5.JS](https://p5js.org/) it is a great way to visualize an idea. My introduction to Python was mainly motivated by the machine learning courses at my university. Both programming languages offer a certain elegance by providing shorthands for really common expressions - After creating something that works you can spend endless hours refining and refactoring the code.

If you want to get in touch with me, an e-mail would be the easiest way. Here is my info:
